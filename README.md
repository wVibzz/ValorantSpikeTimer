# ValorantSpikeTimer
This is an overlay timer that shows how much time is left until the bomb explodes

⚠️THIS WILL BAN YOU AS OF THIS COMMIT⚠️
I LITERALLY GOT BANNED FROM IT IN A CUSTOM 
DO NOT USE IT IN GAME!


I will be working on a solution where 
instead of grabbing the info from the 
game it will grab it from somewhere else.

Since detecting pixels from the game directly
is a big no-no. My idea is to grab the pixels 
from something that copies the screen like OBS
and then overlay a timer onto the main screen
or have AHK make its own OBS-like screen capture 
and detect pixels there or something

I will do this whenever I get unbanned in like 3 months
unless I hwid spoof.
